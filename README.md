# Material Design Controls For iOS

In 2014, Google published the material design specification with a goal to provide guidelines for good design and beautiful UI across all device form factors.
For Android, developers can use default Android controls.
For iOS, we built those controls to bring Google material design to iOS application.

They are native iOS controls which extend default iOS controls to add material design UI.
